# What Makes a Runner Fast?

A multi-modal data visualization study of the physiological, environmental, and demographic factors that determine long-distance running performance.

**University of Milan — Scientific Visualization 2025–2026**

---

## Research Questions

1. Does age determine peak running performance? At what age are runners fastest?
3. How much does race-day temperature affect finish times?
4. Which countries produce the fastest recreational runners?
5. Have finish times changed over the past 20 years despite surging participation?
6. Does training volume (km/week) correlate with performance?
7. What is the overall distribution of finish times by gender?

## Datasets

| # | Dataset | Source | Format | Key variables |
|---|---------|--------|--------|---------------|
| 1 | Marathon Results 2000–2019 (10 major US races, 2.85M finishers) | [Zenodo 6959864](https://zenodo.org/record/6959864) | CSV (~353 MB) | finish time, age, gender, city, year |
| 2 | Strava training data — 36,412 athletes worldwide | [Kaggle: mexwell/long-distance-running-dataset](https://kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/long-distance-running-dataset) | CSV | weekly km, nationality, target marathon |
| 3 | Race-day weather (temperature, precipitation, wind) | [Open-Meteo API](https://open-meteo.com) (free, no key) | JSON / REST API | temp_mean_c, precip_mm, wind_kmh |

**Integration:** Dataset 2 is joined to Dataset 1 at group level on `(gender × age group × city × year)` using the athlete's `major` field. Dataset 3 is joined on `(city, race_date)`.

## How to Run

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib requests geopandas scipy numpy jupyter
```

### 2. Download the data

**Dataset 1 — Marathon results (Zenodo):**
```bash
# Download manually from https://zenodo.org/record/6959864
# Place the CSV file(s) in data/raw/marathon/
```

**Dataset 2 — Strava training data (Kaggle):**
```bash
# Requires Kaggle CLI: pip install kaggle
# Place kaggle.json in ~/.kaggle/
kaggle datasets download -d mexwell/long-distance-running-dataset -p data/raw/athletes/ --unzip
```

**Dataset 3 — Weather:** Fetched automatically in `03_weather_fetch.ipynb` via the Open-Meteo API.

### 3. Run notebooks in order

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

Run `01` → `02` → `03` → `04` → `05`.

## Key Findings

- **Age** — performance peaks at 28–34; non-linear decline accelerates sharply past 50
- **Weather** — race-day temperature is the strongest external predictor (Pearson r = 0.23–0.24); each extra °C adds ~3 min to the median finish time
- **Training volume** — surprisingly weak predictor (r = 0.06); raw km/week explains little of the individual variance
- **Trends** — median finish times barely changed 2000–2019 despite participation nearly doubling
- **Gender** — men 4h22m vs women 4h49m at the median; both distributions are strongly right-skewed
- **Running culture** — Strava data shows Peru, Canada, and Central Europe log the most weekly km among marathon-targeting athletes
